# pc98-reset
Small C program to soft-reset a PC98

I would have done the C++ version in TASM but I didn't have it installed at the time. It's quite a bit larger when compiled with Turbo-C++ (over 32KB vs 524 bytes), even after stripping symbols.

Thanks to [kato](https://people.freebsd.org/~kato/pc98-arch.html)'s page for the how-to.
