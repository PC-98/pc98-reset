# pc98-reset
Small program to soft-reset a PC98.

Comes in ASM (RESET.ASM) and C++ (RESET.CPP) versions. Could be smaller if assembled as a COM file, but is quite small already (524 bytes EXE).

It's quite a bit larger when compiled with Turbo-C++ (over 32KB vs 524 bytes), even after stripping symbols.

Thanks to [kato](https://people.freebsd.org/~kato/pc98-arch.html)'s page for the how-to.
